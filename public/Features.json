    "content": "# Why you should learn Software Engineering instead of just using AI tools\n\nIn an era where AI can generate a React component in seconds, many ask: 'Why bother learning the hard way?' The answer lies in the difference between **writing code** and **engineering systems**.\n\n## 1. The 'Black Box' Problem\nAI tools are probabilistic, not deterministic. They provide answers that *look* right but can contain subtle logic flaws. Without a deep understanding of Software Engineering, you cannot debug what you do not understand. \n\n## 2. Architecture vs. Snippets\nAI is great at functions; humans are great at architecture. An AI might give you a secure login script, but it won't understand how that script impacts your entire system's scalability or how it interacts with a complex Electron middleware. \n\n## 3. The 'Senior' Edge\nAs a Senior Architect, I use AI to **improve my knowledge**, not to replace my brain. I use it to break down complex algorithms or explore new libraries faster. But when the system breaks at 2 AM, it's the engineering fundamentals—understanding memory management, network protocols, and design patterns—that fix the problem.\n\n## My Personal Growth Workflow\n- **Deep Work:** I use the **Pomodoro technique** to maintain intense focus on core logic.\n- **Code Review:** I start every day reviewing code (mine and the AI's) to ensure quality.\n- **AI as a Tutor:** I treat AI as a senior mentor that I constantly double-check. \n\n**Conclusion:** Don't just be a user of tools. Be the person who understands how the tools are built. That is where the real value lies in the modern tech landscape.",
